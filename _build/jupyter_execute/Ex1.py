# ## What is happening with digitization? 
# Technology is vastly increasing the possible choices we have to organise our societies and education. In this session you will explore 4 value statements concerning the future of education (these are drawn from the https://www.nearfutureteaching.ed.ac.uk/ project). 
# 
# Behind each technological possibily lies a set of values with regards to what matters in education.
# 
# We want to find out your views and your values in education. 
# 
# 

# # Instructions
# 
# Here is a form in which you need to select two value statements from below.
# 
# Read the statements carefully, and then choose which of the value statements you prefer over the other one. Then say why you prefer it. 
# 
# This exercise will produce data which we will show you how to analyze using computational tools.
